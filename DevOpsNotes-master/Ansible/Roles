--Ansible Roles
Roles in Ansible are next level of abstraction of Ansible playbooks
--Benefits of Ansible Roles
  idea of include files and combine them to form clean and resuable abstraction
  Easy to maintain/troubleshooting the playbooks
  
--Structure of Roles
  
	files: contains the regular files those need to copy to target folder
	handlers: Event handlers
	meta: Role dependencies
	templates: similar to files but contains dynamic data
	tasks: playbook tasks
	vars/group_vars: variable definitions
