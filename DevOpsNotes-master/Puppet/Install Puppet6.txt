
Step - 1
Instal ntp ntpdate packages to sync date and time on your servers 

sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y ntp ntpdate 
sudo ntpdate -u 0.ubuntu.pool.ntp.org

Step -2

On the master edit the host file and add the IP address of the master itself in the hosts file naming it puppet

Step -3

On the Agent machines add the master IP as puppet and the Agentâ€™s IP address as puppet-agent

Step -4

Follow these steps on both the master and the slave machines
Puppet uses port 8140 to communicate through ssl. Open the port using ufw command 
  
   ufw enable ufw allow 8140

Step -5 ( execute below command on  master and slave machine)
Add the puppet6 repository on all the machines 

apt update wget https://apt.puppetlabs.com/puppet6-release-bionic.deb dpkg -i puppet6-release-bionic.deb 
apt update

Step -6 (Execute command on Master Server)

   apt install -y puppetserver
Step -7 (Master Server)

After the installation, change the memory allocation for Puppet server. The Default setting is 2GB. Set it 1 GB or 512 MB according to the memory allocated to your VM Open the default puppet server file and change the following line 

vi /etc/default/puppetserver
Change
JAVA_ARGS="-Xms2g -Xmx2g

to

JAVA_ARGS="-Xms512m -Xmx512m

and save the changes

Step -8 (Master Server)

Edit the puppet.conf file and add the following lines to it 

vi /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.conf

[main]
certname = puppet
server = puppet
environment = production
runinterval = 15m

Step -9 ( Master Server)

Now, setup the puppetserver certificate.

/opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppetserver ca setup

Step -10 (Master Server)

Start and enable the puppet server Syntax:

 systemctl start puppetserver 
 systemctl enable puppetserver

Step -11(Agent Node)

 Install Puppet Agent 
 apt install -y puppet-agent

Step -12(Agent Node)

Edit the puppet.conf file on agent machine and add the following lines to it Syntax: 

vi /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.conf

  [main]
certname = puppetagent
server = puppet
environment = production
runinterval = 15m

Step -13 (Agent Node)

Start and enable the puppet server on the agent machine Syntax: 

/opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet resource service puppet ensure=running enable=true


Step -14 (Master Node)

First list all the certificates left for signing on the master machine 

Syntax: /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppetserver ca list

You can choose to either individually sign the certificates all sign them all together Syntax: 
/opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppetserver ca sign <certName>

 or 

/opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppetserver ca sign --all

Step -15 (Agent Node)

To verify open the agent and use the test command Syntax: 

/opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet agent --test
